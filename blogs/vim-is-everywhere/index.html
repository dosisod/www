    Lots of people will tell you how powerful Vim is,
    and how much time you can save.
    A lot of their arguments are correct, but I want to take
    a different approach: Vim is all around you, and by
    showing all of the things it has influenced, perhaps I might
    convince you to start using it.

    For starters, <code>vim</code> (VI-iMproved) came out in 1991. Its
    predessesor, <code>vi</code>, came out in 1979. <code>neovim</code>
    , a more modern fork of <code>vim</code> came out in 2014. In general,
    whenever someone says "vim", they are normally talking about the core
    movements that <code>vi</code> provides, and the improved featureset
    of vim (unless otherwise noted).

    In vim, <kbd>/</kbd> is used to start searching for something. On the
    Vue website (which is powered by <a href="https://www.algolia.com/">Algolia</a>),
    <kbd>/</kbd> is used to start searching for something:

    On <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">duckduckgo</a>, you can use <kbd>j</kbd>
    to move down a search result, and <kbd>k</kbd> to go up one. In vim, the
    <kbd>j</kbd>/<kbd>k</kbd> keys are also used to go up and down a line:

    In vim, <kbd>g</kbd> can be followed up with many other characters to provide
    easy access to a bunch of features, such as <kbd>g</kbd><kbd>f</kbd> to go to
    the file name under the cursor, <kbd>g</kbd><kbd>d</kbd> to go to the
    definition of a function/variable, and <kbd>g</kbd><kbd>g</kbd> to go to the
    top of the file. Many websites offer keyboard shortcuts, starting  with
    <kbd>g</kbd>, which are used to navigate around:

    Specifically I am talking about VSCode, but your text editor might
    have similar features. In vscode, when you open the command pallete,
    you can type <code>:123</code> to go to line 123, the same way you
    would do it in vim:

    Now there are an infinite amount of examples I could use here, but I will
    try to stick to using just what is readily/probably already avaiable on
    your system.
  </p>

  <p>
    Firstly, in <code>bash</code>, you can run <code>set -o vi</code> to enable
    vi-like movements as you edit (<kbd>j</kbd>/<kbd>k</kbd> to go to the
    next/previous command, <kbd>h</kbd>/<kbd>l</kbd> to move left/right
    in the current line, <kbd>x</kbd> to delete the currently selected
    character, etc).
  </p>

  <p>
    Whenever you type <code>git commit</code> in your terminal, an editor will
    open up, and sometimes, it will be vim (this dependes on the <code>EDITOR</code>
    and <code>VISUAL</code> environment variables). The same thing happens
    when you do an interactive rebase, or a <code>git merge</code> (sometimes).

  <p>
    Sometimes when running commands with lots of output, it will open it in
    a pager, usually <code>less</code> or <code>more</code>. You can check
    by running <code>readlink -f $(which pager)</code>. In less, you can use
    the arrow keys to move around, but you can also use <kbd>j</kbd>/<kbd>k</kbd>k
    to move up and down, <kbd>u</kbd><kbd>d</kbd> to move up and down (half a page),
    <kbd>/</kbd> to search, <kbd>n</kbd>/<kbd>N</kbd> to go to next and previous
    search result respectivley, and <kbd>q</kbd> to quit. All of these are similar to
    vim, except for quitting (in vim it is <code>:q</code> instead).
